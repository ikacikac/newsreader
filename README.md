# OwnCloud News reader

## Idea

Idea behind making this project is to try and make application for Chrome, Android and FirefoxOS. My first try was project [news-reader](https://github.com/owncloud/news-mobile). While that application was intended to be used on FirefoxOS and Android, it lacks some better understanding of AngularJS concepts and was made as my first contact with modern frontend development.

This project, while at first developed for OwnCloud News feeds, is not intended to remain just for OwnCloud. Also, building Chrome extension from it is primary goal. Versions for FirefoxOs and Android will also be included in future.

At the and this project was made while improving AngularJS knowledge, and is by no mean best example. That is why I'd like anyone who feels free to contribute. Thank you!

## Stack

Libraries used for project are:
 - AngularJS 1.2.23 (and couple of modules not included in main one) as application framework,
 - Bootstrap 3.2 for UX, 
 - Yeoman tools for building and working with project,
 - Karma and Jasmine for unit testing,
 - Angular Bind Once for reducing the number of $watched variable which are never changed, 
 - Angular Local Storage for accessing browser's local storage
